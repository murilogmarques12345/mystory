**story**
Once upon a time three little pigs were set to live anywhere, their mother said "you guys are old enough to go live on your own" So the three little pigs went throughout the forest and were finding an area to build their homes.
The pigs scattered out in the woods for a spot to make their homes, till they came across a perfect spot to go ahead and build their homes.
